# Login-form-using-HTML-and-CSS
This repository contains the HTML &amp; CSS code required for a login form. Since I am using only HTML &amp; CSS to create this form there will not be any interactive gestures with the action buttons.
I am stilling modifying this file till its gets interactive. 
Hope this will help some of the beginers who just start coding in the domain of Web Development.
Thank you!
